                Howdy! I'm Maxcell Prince Wilson, but you can call me Prince. I am a person who cares about making 
                better communities one step at a time. Whether it is through giving talks at meetups/conferences,
                or building and securing technology to make people's lives better.

                I work as an instructor over at <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>, powered by <a href="https://wework.com/">WeWork</a>. 
                Some of my previous work includes working at Clarifai and State Farm Insurance. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science 
                with a focus in security over at the University of Central Florida. Back in school, I founded our tech club with a bunch of my friends,
                known as Tech Knights. We also created our first intercollegiate hackathon known as Knight Hacks.

                Now, I enjoy exploring New York City and really getting to experience a new world! I look for opportunities to give
                back to communities that helped me become who I am today, through mentorship and open source. But most of all, I really really love corgis.
