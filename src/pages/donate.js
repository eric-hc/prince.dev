    <h2>#BlackLivesMatter</h2>
    <p>
      Being Black in tech is absolutely difficult because many folks are not interested in this sensitive topic even when it is happening predominantly in the world. But I want you to take some time and make a donation to an organization because anything you can give matters. If you can convince your employer to give something, it matters. If you can just take some time and amplify these places as opportunities, it matters.
