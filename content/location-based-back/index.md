In much of the code we write, we have to think about designing software that
can handle the current requirements and create opportunity for other developers to
come in to change the code whenever the requirements change. An example of this
came up when I was dealing with changing around some pieces of our code that handles
navigational flow within our application.

In our application, we wanted to have a back button on some pages that would return
users to the previous page they were looking at. Originally we handled this through
inserting a redirect path within our query parameters.

```js
// You'll notice at the end we have a query parameter (?redirect_url=)
// that said where we came from and so we would use that param
// to send us to the previous page
const currentUrl = 'http://somecoolwebsite.com/posts/12341?redirect_url=/posts'

// Parse out the redirect_url
// ...

// Send us to the previous page
history.push(redirectUrl) // This would be "/posts"
```

This worked! Closed ticket, shut laptop and let's call it a day -- not quite.

At the last second, the requirements changed and you gotta handle more cases.
In our redirect url, we can't pass in any previous query parameters that were there,
so all context might be removed from the page. In addition, when you think about
"going back" you wouldn't want to add more history (`history.push()`) so I also
wanted to think about how could we tidy up this code.

## Links to the rescue!

In [React Router][react router], the `Link` component is commonly used with a `to` prop as a string:

```jsx
function BlogPostLink({ post }) {
  const { slug, title } = post

  return <Link to={`/post/${slug}`}>{title}</Link>
}
```

You can instead use an object for the `to` value! If we wanted to recreate the same
behavior, the code would look like this:

```jsx{5}
function BlogPostLink({ post }) {
  const { slug, title } = post

  // `pathname` value is equivalent to the string form `to`
  return <Link to={{ pathname: `/post/${slug}` }}>{title}</Link>
}
```

Now, you can pass in additional context through the key `state`.
This optional key allows you to pass in information that can be used for things
such as location-based rendering. It should take the shape of an object.
It is intentionally something we have to set for it to appear in the location object.

```jsx{5-10}
function BlogPostLink({ post }) {
  const { slug, title } = post
  return (
    <Link
      to={{
        pathname: `/post/${slug}`,
        state: {
          fromBlogRoll: true,
        },
      }}
    >
      {title}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

## Location-based rendering

Now that we have this state being inserted into our location object, where does
the actual **magic** happen. It is when we want our back button to change. Let's
say we want to have special text for when we are coming directly from the blog
roll vs. any other page

```jsx{10}
function BackButton(props) {
  // See documentation about React Router's Hook API
  // https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Hooks
  const history = useHistory()
  const location = useLocation()

  // Here we're checking to see if state exists for our location, it will
  // always have the key but we want to 1) verify it was set and 2) that
  // the state we received is something we've intentionally set
  const fromBlogRoll = location.state && location.state.fromBlogRoll

  return fromBlogRoll ? (
    <button onClick={() => hisory.goBack()}>Back to Blog Roll</button>
  ) : (
    <button onClick={() => history.push('/home')}>Home</button>
  )
}
```

Now we have a nice back button for our needs. This will take advantage of the history
object, so if we want to go back and still have all our query parameters, they will
be there as well as any other things we've stored in our app's state. This also
handles for the case of what if a user directly shares the link to someone else
and instead of seeing a back button, they should see a home button. This also works
for applications that might want to have sharable links but not let unauthenticated users
navigate through certain parts of the app. It will fallback and present a home button
and so we can assure that our page has navigation.

An important note is we want to make sure in this case also is to use the
`location` object and **not** the `history` object for determining the **current location**
state. The [history object can be mutated][history documentation] and
makes it not a good source of truth.

## Last Thoughts

Every time a bug is raised into a codebase I work on, I think about how can I make
something a bit better than when I found it. Of course this is super subjective.
I like to try to reduce down complexities where I can and how to take advantage
of tools that are closer within reach. With React Router, the tools were there for
me and it is a bit easier to manage the complexities of the UI logic.
