I've been recently migrating away from `gatsby-remark-prismjs` to `prism-react-renderer`, which if you're
doing the same you can read about [here][blog-post]! To keep the same feel for my readers (like yourself),
I needed to also make sure I could support one of my favorite features: line highlighting!

## Why is Line Highlighting Important?

Now you might be wondering, "Why bother?" Well, have you ever read a blog post but 
felt super lost in what would be important to get out of the code blocks they shown? 
What about seeing big blocks of code and not quite what changed across the two? This is where I 
think line highlighting really helps!

It makes you, the author, pay more attention to what you need to be communicating, visually and written.

## Adding Line Highlight with `prism-react-renderer`

When using MDX, the `code` [shortcode][MDX-code] passes 3 props `className`, `children`, `metastring` by default.
In my [migration post][blog-post], we used `className` to display the correct styling by language and the
`children` prop was the actual code we want to display. The newest prop is `metastring`
which is a string representation of everything following the backticks and language (**THE SPACE IS IMPORTANT**):

```md
There are some limitations such as trying to render
markdown code blocks in a codeblock ðŸ˜…
 
But ignoring the leading #, we would use this to denote a codeblock
# ```js {1,2,3-4}
```

This metastring can be used for all sorts of things, but for now we'll focus on
getting out the lines! I used a package, `parse-numeric-range`, that will help with parsing
ranges which you'll want to add through either `npm` or `yarn`. Then in my `CodeBlock` component,
I added a bit of code:

```jsx {3,8-17}
// src/components/CodeBlock.jsx
import React from 'react'
import rangeParser from 'parse-numeric-range';
import Highlight, { defaultProps } from 'prism-react-renderer'

// Create a closure that determines if we have
// to highlight the given index
const calculateLinesToHighlight = (meta) => {
  const RE = /{([\d,-]+)}/
  if (RE.test(meta)) {
    const strlineNumbers = RE.exec(meta)[1]
    const lineNumbers = rangeParser(strlineNumbers)
    return (index) => (lineNumbers.includes(index + 1))
  } else {
    return () => false
  }
}

// ...
```

This `calculateLinesToHighlight` will actually return a function that can be executed to determine
if it is a line to highlight. This will make it so we don't need to recompute what the range is every
time we check for a line. The only acceptable characters inside of the `{}` are numbers, `-`, and `,`.

Then we can go into our actual render for the codeblock and add:

```jsx {3,11}
// src/components/CodeBlock.jsx
// ...
  const shouldHighlightLine = calculateLinesToHighlight(metastring)

  return (
    <Highlight {...defaultProps} code={children} language={language}>
      {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
        <pre className={className} style={{ ...style }}>
          {tokens.map((line, index) => {
            const lineProps = getLineProps({ line, key: index })
            if (shouldHighlightLine(index)) { lineProps.className = `${lineProps.className} highlight-line` }
            return (
              <div key={index} {...lineProps}>
                {line.map((token, key) => (
                  <span key={key}{...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
                ))}
              </div>
            )
          })}
        </pre>
      )}
    </Highlight>
  )
```

If we need to highlight our line through `shouldHighlightLine`, we will need to add `highlight-line`
to the `className` string for the line. This is finally then missing what the value it should receive:

```css
/* inside of my custom theme */

/* Handles the actual highlighting process */
.highlight-line {
  background-color: rgb(53, 59, 69);
  display: block;
  margin-right: -1em;
  margin-left: -1em;
  padding-right: 1em;
  padding-left: 0.75em;
  border-left: 0.3em solid #f99;
}
```

And from there, this should now allow you to go and write your own line highlights in
your code blocks! Feel free to customize your line highlighting to your needs. You will now
be able to write the same things you were writing before in your markdown files in your MDX
files. As a final reminder, the code blocks will need a space after you declare the language
in order for the meta string to be picked up! I spent a good amount of time frustrated wondering,
why the heck isn't it working! Don't be like past me, learn from my mistakes!
