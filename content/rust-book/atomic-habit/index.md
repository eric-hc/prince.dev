  - Being able to highlight a clear vision of when you will do a thing, how you do it
  as well as where.
  - Transforms them into a concrete action. Helps develop clarity
- Habit Stacking
  - Pair a new habit with an old habit

  - Don't build a habit stack in places that are inconvenient to you already
  - Build the habit stack in places that occur the frequency you'd like
