This is just a running list of notes along the way as I read the Rust Programming
Language Book. It is helpful for me to write out my raw thoughts 

### Chapter 1

Documentation is local, offline avaibility. One can always get the documentation
directly with the terminal through `rustup doc`. It isn't just documentation but
also other pieces such as "Rust by Example".

Unlike other programming languages such as JavaScript or Ruby, Rust splits apart 
the idea of compilation and execution.

Macros are different than functions. Super important to understanding each of their roles
however not much detail into that yet.

We have a built-in dependency manager in Rust called `Cargo`. It also handles how to
build our projects. In Rust, dependencies are referred to as **_crates_**. These 
will be found within the `Cargo.toml` files. It is similar to how a `package.json`
works within Node. Similiar as well, Cargo generates `.lock` files as well.

Some common Cargo info to make note of:
  - `cargo build` - creates an executable from Cargo.toml
  - `./target/debug/<file_name>` - location of executable
  - `cargo run` - builds and executes
  - `cargo check` - checks for compilation
    - May be useful to run more often than build if checking validity
  - `cargo build --release` compiles with optimizations

### Chapter 2

This was a project chapter, so I am writing down a lot of my internal
interpretations of the lines and coupling it with things that may be
explicitly written to make sure I have a good understanding.

#### Breaking down the project

```rs
use std::io;
```

To include libraries we will use the `use` keyword
and typically put them towards the top. `std::io` represents the standard 
library and we're pulling out a set of traits & functions(?) for input/output.

```rs
let mut bar = String::new();
```

- `let` is used for creating variables
- Variables are default to immutable, so we add `mut` to change them
- `associated function` (`::`) on the type and not an instance
  - sometimes called a static method
- `&` reference and by default are also immutable

`.expect("Failed to read line")`
- Is a way for us to handle failed `Result` types from io

`"You guessed: {}", guess`
- `{}` represents placeholders or string interpolation

`use rand::Rng` - Adds the `Rng` trait from rand
- `rand::thread_rng().gen_range(inclusive, exclusive)`

`cargo doc --open` - let's you figure out the methods, functions, and traits

`use std::cmp::Ordering` - an enum like `Result` from `.expect`

Shadowing a variable - converting a variable from one type to another is a common case

u32 - unsigned 32-bit integers

`loop` for infinite loops and `break` to break out

`match` looks for something like `Ok` or `Err`. Whatever the result looks like will determine how the call should handle it

### Chapter 3


#### Variables and Constants

Variables are immutable by default. In order to reassign the variables,
we have to declare them mutable and then we can.

Constants cannot be `mut`. They are always immutable. Must have its 
value type annotated. Must be an expression not a function or computed 
at runtime.

Shadowing - Declaring a new variable with the same name as the second.
It is different than marking something with `mut`. This allows us to
perform transformations on a value and then have the variable be 
immutable after those transformations have been completed. Also useful
for performing type transformations. We can't do this with replacing
with `mut`.

There are two data type subsets: scalar and compound
- Scalars are a single value. Composed of 4 primary types:
  1. integers (signed and unsigned)
  2. floating-point (IEEE-754)
  3. Booleans
  4. characters (emoji)
- Compound which group multiple values into one type. Composed of two:
  1. Tuples - fixed size length
    - Access positions with `.` and the index
  2. Array - every element must be the same type. Are fixed in size
    - If you want to grow your array, you should be using a vector

<Callout>

**What does this mean?**
> _"Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap"_

</Callout>

#### Functions

Prefer to have snake case and use `fn` keyword
Parameters must have the type declared
Assignments don't return values so no multiassigns

We can create blocks and the expressions can be evaluated

```rs
let y = {
  let x = 3;
  x + 1 // important not to have a semi-colon
};
```

Implicit returns must not have a semicolon

#### Control Flow

```rs
fn main(){
  let number = 3;

  if number < 5 {
    println!("condition was true");
  } else {
    println!("condition was false");
  }.
}
```
The value in the `if` must be a Boolean

You can also use an `if` in a variable statement

```rs
let condition = true;
let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
```

The types between the two cases must be same. Must have both if/else.

#### Repetition with Loops

- `loop`, `while`, `for`

To do a loop, just `loop` block!
we can return values in a look with a `break`

`while` are conditional based
`for` through a collection
`for element in a.iter()`
